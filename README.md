Getting Started
Before you proceed, ensure you have completed the initial setup for React Native Expo. If not, please follow the Expo - Getting Started guide.

Starting the Development Server
To start the development server, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npx expo start
When you run this command, the Expo CLI starts a development server and generates a QR code.

Using Expo Go
Expo Go is a free, open-source sandbox for learning and experimenting with React Native on Android and iOS devices. It's not recommended for building production-quality apps or deploying/distributing apps. Instead, use it to experiment and learn.

To use Expo Go:

Install Expo Go on your device. It is available on both the Android Play Store (for Android Lollipop 5 and greater) and iOS App Store (for iOS 13 and greater).

When you run npx expo start in your project, the development server generates a QR code.

On your Android device, open the Expo Go app and press "Scan QR Code" on the Home tab. Scan the QR code to connect to the development server.

On your iPhone or iPad, open the default Apple Camera app and scan the QR code to connect to the development server.

You can use Expo Go to quickly test your app on real devices and experiment with new ideas.

Local Development
For local development, refer to the Local App Development guide. This guide provides essential information to optimize your development workflow.

Local Compilation
For local development, refer to the Local App Development guide. This guide provides essential information to optimize your development workflow and covers local app compilation.

Local App Compilation
To build your project locally, you can use compile commands from Expo CLI, which generate the android and ios directories:

bash
Copy code
npx expo run:android
bash
Copy code
npx expo run:ios
These commands will compile your app for Android and iOS, respectively.

Congratulations! :tada:
